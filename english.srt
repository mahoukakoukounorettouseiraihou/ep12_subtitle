1
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,330
Does this job start from tomorrow evening?

2
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:47,080
Yeah, that's right. I guess we should be
on the lookout from around five.

3
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,200
The expected enemy goes by the name,
"New Breed Front."

4
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,370
Our role is to prevent terrorist attacks

5
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,080
and obtain any info about
the enemy organization.

6
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,370
Wrong, Fumiya.

7
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,830
Did you read our orders carefully?

8
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,700
Our job this time out is

9
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:09,490
to get intel on the New Breed Front's
headquarters and source of funding.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,950
It doesn't say anything
about preventing terrorist attacks.

11
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,120
But we can't just stand by
and do nothing.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,450
Fumiya, we mustn't get
our priorities mixed up.

13
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,740
We're going to capture the terrorists
in order to gather information.

14
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,080
And if that prevents a terrorist act
as a result, it's all to the good.

15
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,580
But if we prioritize the prevention
of terrorist attacks and kill them all,

16
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,330
that would mean we failed in our mission.

17
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,290
I know.

18
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,740
Do you really?

19
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,370
Among the Yotsuba branch families,

20
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,580
the Kuroba Family is in charge
of gathering intelligence,

21
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:49,240
and we are expected to accomplish our
missions rather than worry about justice.

22
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,290
I know that much.

23
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,560
APRIL 7, 2096 - TOKYO OFFSHORE TOWER

24
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,080
Thank you for coming today,
Miyuki and Tatsuya.

25
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,910
No, thank you for inviting us.

26
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,790
So, Erika and the others aren't coming?

27
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:00,330
No. She said it was a pain.

28
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,790
That's just like Erika.

29
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,490
At any rate, the view
from the top floor here is breathtaking.

30
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,490
Tokyo Offshore Tower.

31
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,660
Japan's first hyperbuilding.

32
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:16,450
360 floors aboveground
and 36 floors underground.

33
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,490
I heard that the Sky Lounge
on the top floor is 2,000 meters high...

34
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,080
but this exceeds my expectations.

35
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
Still, being at this height
makes me a tad nervous.

36
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,410
Would the building collapse
in an accident or earthquake?

37
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,540
No problem there.

38
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,120
This building is supported
by four gigantic pillars.

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,410
Each pillar stands erect
due to the gyroscopic effect of the flywheels

40
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,330
which have been installed on the 36th
underground floor and on every 60th floor,

41
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:47,450
starting with the first underground floor.

42
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,870
The flywheels wouldn't stop
operating during a power outage?

43
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,160
If that happens,

44
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,370
the magicians who are stationed
underground will make the flywheels spin.

45
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,950
They also reduce the friction
of the vibration control dampers

46
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,290
that support the pillars and enhance
the effectiveness of the base isolation.

47
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,080
That's unusual for magicians
to be involved in safety measures.

48
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,450
Yeah. Cases like this are extremely rare.

49
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,290
Brother...

50
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,660
Yeah.

51
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,160
Honoka, Shizuku,
we're going to step out for a bit.

52
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,660
Sorry.

53
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,040
Well, well... Miyuki and Tatsuya.

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,410
Are you also guests at this party?

55
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,830
Yes. Our friend invited us.

56
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,910
Are you here on behalf
of our aunt, Mr. Hayama?

57
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:48,990
Yes. Madam sent me here
to keep an eye on things.

58
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:54,040
Does my aunt have concerns
about this party?

59
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,450
It's because this is the first time a building
in Japan has magicians involved in this manner.

60
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,990
Madam hopes that nothing happens here.

61
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,080
That reminds me, aren't you working
at the entrance ceremony tomorrow, Miyuki?

62
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,660
My advice would be
to get plenty of rest for the occasion.

63
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,040
Thank you for your kindness.

64
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,700
I'll consult with my brother,
and we'll leave the party at a suitable time.

65
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:34,910
I apologize for being overbearing.

66
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,290
Oh, you've come at a good time.

67
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,120
Say hello to Miyuki...

68
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,580
Sakurai.

69
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,240
Hello, Miyuki.

70
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,160
My name is Minami Sakurai.

71
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,370
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.

72
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,580
Yes.

73
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,450
Likewise, it's nice to meet you.

74
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,290
Miyuki...

75
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,290
Sakurai here is the niece
of Honami Sakurai

76
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,240
who served as Madam Miya's
personal attendant.

77
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,330
I believe she could be useful
to you, as well,

78
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,660
so I would ask you to keep her in mind.

79
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,740
Understood.

80
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,870
If I ever need help with something,
I'll count on you.

81
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,620
I am honored by those words.

82
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,830
Please don't hesitate
to ask me to do anything.

83
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:44,120
Well, we had best be on our way.

84
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,490
I have a visual confirmation
of two suspicious-looking people.

85
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,580
They're dressed
in power company work uniforms

86
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:22,790
and appear to be heading toward the
inspection port of the submarine power cables.

87
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,790
So, you think they're agents
disguised as utility workers?

88
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,370
Yami...

89
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,790
Don't scare me like that, Sister!

90
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,290
Sorry. I didn't think
you'd be that surprised.

91
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,540
Jeez...

92
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,080
S-o-r-r-y.

93
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,790
N-Never mind! Just get off of me!

94
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,990
True, we are working.

95
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,160
That's right. Jeez.

96
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,870
Yes. That's why I apologized.

97
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,660
Anyway, Yami,

98
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,540
what should we do about them?

99
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,910
What should we do?

100
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,910
The head of the family ordered us
to detain agents of the New Breed Front.

101
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:28,290
We won't know if they're members
of that organization unless we capture them,

102
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,490
but the issue is,
when do we capture them?

103
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:32,660
When?

104
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,330
I mean, if they try
to tamper with the power cables,

105
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:42,080
do we catch them
before or after their work is done?

106
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,950
We should obviously
capture them beforehand, duh!

107
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,040
Yami, watch your language.

108
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,120
Why is it so obvious to you?

109
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,870
Well, they're plotting
a terrorist attack, right?

110
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,410
It's only natural that we stop them.

111
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,910
That's my opinion anyway.

112
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,990
If we were police officers, yes.

113
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:08,450
But if you think about it
in terms of our objective,

114
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,490
wouldn't it be easier and more efficient if we
waited for the terrorists to let their guard down

115
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,580
after they've completed their task?

116
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,950
If we interfere beforehand,
when they have their guard up...

117
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:22,830
there's more of a risk
that they'll counterattack. Understand?

118
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,990
I think you're right, Sister,

119
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:31,910
but I can't just watch those bastards
engage in despicable acts of terrorism!

120
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:38,200
You don't sound like a girl there,
but I agree with what you're saying, personally.

121
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,870
I do like your cheap sense of justice.

122
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,870
"Cheap"...

123
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,660
Well...

124
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,450
let's get to work.

125
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,040
VISITOR ARC XII

126
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,120
First, I'll cloak the cabin
with Perfect Diffusion.

127
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,120
Then, I'll send you in
with Mock Teleportation. All right?

128
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,410
Are you ready?

129
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,290
Go ahead. Fly me in.

130
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:45,450
Magicians... But it looks like
they haven't noticed Perfect Diffusion.

131
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:48,450
Sister's skills just keep improving.

132
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,910
Here I go!

133
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,580
Hey! What happened?

134
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,080
Direct Pain.

135
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,870
There's less leakage of residual Psions
than on our mission three months ago.

136
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,830
You've improved yet again, Fumiya.

137
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:22,870
Fumiya is the attacker,
and I'm the backup.

138
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,080
It's important that the enemy
doesn't notice the backup,

139
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,990
but the attacker's role is to subdue the enemy
in a minimal amount of time.

140
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:34,370
You've become a dependable boy, Fumiya.

141
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,120
Even if your appearance isn't there yet.

142
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,990
I'm done here, Sister.

143
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,450
Roger that.

144
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,410
I'm on my way.

145
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,040
Yami!

146
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:04,910
Sister!

147
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,660
Yami!

148
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,410
Did you see that?

149
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:15,160
Yes. Are you going in?

150
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,290
Yeah. Please.

151
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,240
Well done, Yami.

152
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,700
What can I say?

153
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,660
It doesn't look like there are
backup troops hiding here.

154
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,700
I agree.

155
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,830
I don't sense any magicians watchin' us.

156
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,120
There you go again!
When you're a girl, you don't drop your g's!

157
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,450
Oh, come on, leave me alone.

158
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:56,370
Lady Yoru, Lady Yami, are you safe?

159
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,200
Safe and sound.

160
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,620
We've captured two prisoners.

161
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,200
You know our location, right?

162
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,490
Yes. We have it.

163
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,580
Shall we pick you up?

164
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,160
If you get close enough to see us,
that's good enough.

165
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,620
As you wish, Lady Yoru.

166
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,620
There we go.

167
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,990
What is this Psionic wave?

168
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,740
Is Fumiya fighting someone?

169
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,660
Ayako is there, too.

170
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,830
They've already captured the enemy.
Skillfully executed.

171
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,790
The enemy belongs to...

172
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:52,200
"New Breed Front," a group
of radical magician supremacists.

173
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,540
Brother, is something bothering you?

174
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,790
No.

175
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:04,120
I was just blown away
by the lineup of guests at this party.

176
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:08,410
Good job, Yami.

177
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,950
I'm going to send over the prisoners first.

178
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,370
Roger that.

179
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,240
Two prisoners, confirmed.

180
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,740
Now you can come aboard, miss.

181
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,080
Right.

182
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,990
Well done, miss.

183
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,700
Thank you.

184
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,620
Well done, sir.

185
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,620
Idiot!

186
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,330
It's "miss," not "sir"!

187
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,700
He put aside his pride to cross-dress!

188
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Are you trying to ruin that?

189
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:52,620
Sir... I mean "miss"...
My humble apologies.

190
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,540
You're ruining it more than anyone!

191
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:59,370
And I'm not cross-dressing!
This is a disguise!

192
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,040
Y-Yes, it's a brilliant disguise.

193
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,370
Even we would never suspect
it was you, Master Fumiya.

194
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,370
That's right.

195
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:08,830
Don't call me by my real name!
That makes the disguise pointless!

196
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,160
Okay, okay.

197
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,290
Both of you, calm down.

198
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,910
We're wasting time here. Let's go.

199
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,580
Yes, miss!

200
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,990
And Yami, don't lose your cool. Okay?

201
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,040
Shizuku, Honoka, congratulations
on advancing to the next grade!

202
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Congratulations, Sister and Honoka!

203
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,790
Congratulations. Both of you have
excellent grades. That's truly wonderful.

204
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,370
Thank you very much.

205
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,990
Thank you.

206
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:50,990
By the way, Honoka, I hear
you have a crush on someone. Is that true?

207
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,700
Oh? I can't let that go by!

208
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,490
What's he like?

209
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,120
Don't say that, Mr. Kitayama!

210
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,870
Brother...

211
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,200
Earlier, what were you really thinking about?

212
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,450
Fumiya and Ayako were fighting
radicalized magicians near this building.

213
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:21,330
Then, Mr. Hayama is here to keep an eye on...

214
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,450
I'm sure it has something to do with that.

215
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,790
Miyuki...

216
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,950
Do you know about a group
called the "New Breed Front"?

217
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Aren't they a group standing up
against anti-magic prejudice?

218
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,410
That's right.

219
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,370
They're an extremist group claiming that
magicians are the most evolved form of humans

220
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,870
and are trying to build a society
where magicians reign supreme.

221
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,620
They're a troublesome group

222
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,910
that are willing to resort to armed conflict
to liberate the oppressed magicians.

223
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:54,330
What do such extremists
want with this building?

224
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:58,040
I don't know
what the New Breed Front's goal is.

225
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,660
For now, Fumiya and Ayako have prevented...

226
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,910
the sabotage of the power cables
that provide electricity to this tower.

227
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:11,410
I just hope it ends there.

228
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,830
I see.

229
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,870
APRIL 7, 2096 - TOKYO OFFSHORE TOWER - 35th UNDERGROUND FLOOR - WAITING ROOM FOR MAGICIANS

230
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,200
Leader, the power supply hasn't stopped.

231
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,200
It seems they failed to cut the cable.

232
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,080
Let's move on to Plan B.

233
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,120
After incapacitating the security guards
and magicians on this floor...

234
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,740
we'll take over the power control room
on the 34th underground floor.

235
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,120
We'll disconnect
the power supply to the flywheels...

236
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,870
and contain the control center
on the first underground floor.

237
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,990
Until then, be extremely sparing
with your use of magic.

238
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,290
Roger!

239
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,910
Are you ready?

240
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,950
Is there anyone on the lowest floor?

241
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,040
No, nobody.

242
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,700
It's empty just as our prior info stated.

243
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,910
Then, we'll gain total control
of the 34th floor as planned.

244
00:19:58,910 --> 00:19:59,910
Roger!

245
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:17,990
Brother, what happened?

246
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,490
Probably them.

247
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,040
The posture stabilization flywheels
have stopped moving?

248
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,620
Then, this building will...

249
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,950
Don't worry.

250
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,700
The walls and pillars aren't damaged.
It won't fall right away.

251
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:42,160
We are the New Breed Front.
Our aim is to restore the rights of magicians.

252
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,330
We don't intend to harm you.

253
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:55,620
We just want you to witness
what will happen here today.

254
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,870
They hijacked the control center
on the first underground floor.

255
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,950
There should've been security guards...

256
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,990
but they must've taken them out.

257
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,990
Magicians are being used as slave labor
deep in the bowels of this building.

258
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,990
Slave labor?

259
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,950
I heard they were well-treated.

260
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,240
And it's work
that doesn't allow them to escape

261
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,910
should disaster strike
on the 35th underground floor.

262
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:23,790
It's as if they've been ordered
to be buried alive in such a scenario.

263
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,910
As a group seeking to restore
the rights of magicians

264
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,830
and as members of a civilized society,

265
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:34,450
we can't allow these antiquated
practices of human sacrifice!

266
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,490
Even if they were trapped inside,

267
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:40,660
as far as I know, the underground would
become a shelter where they could survive.

268
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,830
As a sign of protest, we are going to set off
a bomb in this building one hour from now.

269
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,040
Everyone who is in there now,
please evacuate immediately.

270
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:55,990
However, if anyone tries to interfere with us,
we will blow up the building right away.

271
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,660
We do not wish to have
a large number of casualties.

272
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,490
Rather, we hope you make the wise decision
to become witnesses to history.

273
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:22,080
I guess hoping that nothing would happen
was too much to ask for.

274
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,040
VISITOR ARC XIII
